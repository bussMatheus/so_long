# A simple 2D game built using the MiniLibX graphical library. üëæ

Project Developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. The game consists of navigating a player through a map to collect all items and reach the exit.
The project focuses on fundamental concepts like parsing, pathfinding, and event handling in C.

Features:
- Map Parsing & Validation: Ensures the map contains only allowed characters and validates the structure (rectangular shape, correct placement of player, collectibles, and exit).
 
- Pathfinding Logic: Uses a flood fill algorithm to guarantee that all collectibles and the exit are reachable.

- User Controls: Move the player using keyboard inputs (in this case WASD or arrow keys).

- Error Handling: Detects invalid maps and handles edge cases, such as missing exits or unreachable collectibles.

- Memory Management: Fully functional, with no memory leaks.
